# mapping_earthquakes Overview  
This project uses data provided to show a visual repersentation of all of the earthquakes on the planet over the few days. This project was created using Javascript's leaflet and d3 libraries, mapbox's api, and geoJson data from usgs.gov. The final product is in the earthquake_challenge folder.
